    Hobbies
  </h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy playing sports such as football, tennis and table tennis, but I also enjoy going on runs, at home after School I normally do my Homework first and then watch a movie or go to the gym. But if I am feeling very productive I will log into Thonny and do some coding. But I have very much enjoyed doing the snakify challenges this summer as it is challenging and fun.
